Show me how to love you
Tell me how to hold you
I'll be who you want to
Baby let me know
Show me how to please you
Baby this is real
I'll be who you want to
Baby please make me feel

Hit me where the heart is, let me know
What the best part is, I should grow

Love me, love me like I used to
Love me like I used to when I was around
Please love me, love me like I used to
Love me like I used to when I was around
Darling let me know
